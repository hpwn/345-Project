Trie Data Structure Implementation in Java

This project contains a Trie data structure implementation in Java. 
The Trie class provides methods for inserting, searching, and deleting words. 
The TrieNode class is a helper class used to represent nodes in the Trie.

To run the code:

Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Save the TrieNode.java, Trie.java, and TrieTest.java files in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the files, 
and compile the Java files using the following command:

javac TrieNode.java Trie.java TrieTest.java

Run the TrieTest class using the following command:

java TrieTest

The TrieTest class demonstrates the Trie data structure's functionality, including inserting, searching, and deleting words. The output should be as follows:

Searching for 'hello': true
Searching for 'world': true
Searching for 'trie': true
Searching for 'tree': true
Searching for 'missing': false
Searching for 'hello' after deletion: false
